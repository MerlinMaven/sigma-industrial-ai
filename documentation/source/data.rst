Industrial Process Simulation
=============================

Overview
--------

The data used in this project is **generated from a simulated industrial process** modeled in **RoboDK**, a professional software for offline programming and simulation of industrial robots. This simulation serves as a digital twin of a real-world packaging and palletizing process, allowing data collection in a controlled and replicable environment.

.. note:: 
    The original simulation is publicly available on the official RoboDK website:
      
    **ðŸ”— Official RoboDK Project**: https://robodk.com/example/Mixed-Applications-with-UR10e

RoboDK enables the creation of complete robotic cells, simulates realistic industrial workflows, and allows extraction of operational data such as positions, speeds, and accelerations â€” essential for machine learning tasks like predictive maintenance or anomaly detection.

Simulation Description
----------------------

The simulated process represents an automated **depalletizing, boxing (bottle filling), and palletizing** system for bottles. It includes three main stages:

1. **Depalletizing**: A robot picks empty boxes from a pallet and places them on a conveyor.
2. **Boxing**: A second robot fills each box with several bottles delivered by a separate conveyor.
3. **Palletizing**: A third robot, mounted on a vertical linear rail, stacks the filled boxes onto a new pallet.

Cell Components
---------------

UR10e Robots
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Three **UR10e** robotic arms are used in the simulation:

- **Robot 1**: Handles the depalletizing of empty boxes.
- **Robot 2**: Performs the boxing by placing bottles into the boxes.
- **Robot 3**: Mounted on a vertical rail to palletize the full boxes.

The **UR10e** is a 6-axis collaborative robot with a 1300 mm reach and a 10 kg payload, well-suited for packaging and handling tasks.

Conveyors
^^^^^^^^^

Two conveyors support the material flow within the cell:

- **Conveyor_Box**: Transports empty or filled boxes.
- **Conveyor_Bottle**: Delivers bottles to the boxing robot.

Vertical Linear Rail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The third robot is mounted on a **vertical linear rail** to reach various pallet layers during the stacking operation.

Data Collection
---------------

Throughout the simulation, the following data is collected for each component (robots, conveyors, rail):

- **Cartesian positions** (X, Y, Z) 
- **Joint velocities & accelerations** (for robots)  
- **Linear speeds & accelerations** (for conveyors & rail)  
- **Timestamps**

The data is recorded in **real-time** and saved in **CSV format**, capturing the full operational cycle. This dataset consists only of **normal operation data**, representing the systemâ€™s standard behavior without faults or disruptions. This choice ensures the generation of a baseline for anomaly detection, where the machine learning models will learn the expected behavior and flag deviations that could indicate potential issues.

Getting Started
----------------

This section guides you through setting up the environment, running the simulation in **RoboDK**, and collecting data using the provided **Jupyter Notebook**.

Prerequisites
-------------

- âœ… **RoboDK** installed on your machine  
  âž¤ Download: https://robodk.com/download  
- âœ… **Python 3.8+** with `jupyter`, `robodk`, `numpy`, `pandas` (all libraries used are already listed in the repository)

ðŸ“¦ **All required files (simulation, notebook) are included in this GitHub repository** â€” no extra downloads needed.

Local Workflow
--------------

Follow these steps to run the simulation and collect data:

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine:  
   ðŸ”— `sigma-industrial-ai <https://github.com/MerlinMaven/sigma-industrial-ai.git>`_

2. Open **RoboDK**. Then, in the cloned repository, open the simulation file: ``files/simulation.rdk`` 


3. Launch **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**, and open the file: ``notebooks/data_collection.ipynb``

4. Run all cells to connect via the `robodk` API and generate the CSV files.

.. note::

   **Data Collection Environment**  
   While Googleâ€¯Colab provides a convenient cloud-based Jupyter interface, it **cannot directly connect** to a locally running RoboDK instance because Colabâ€™s execution environment is isolated from your machineâ€™s localhost network. 

   To collect data in realâ€¯time from RoboDK, you have two practical options:

   1. **Local Jupyter Notebook**  
      Run your Python dataâ€‘collection script in a standard Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab on the same PC where RoboDK is installed. This local setup can connect outâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘box to the RoboDK API (`robodk`) over TCP/IP. 

   2. **Colab with a Local Runtime**  
      If you still wish to use Colabâ€™s interface, you can expose a local Jupyter server to Colab using the `jupyter_http_over_ws` extension. This lets Colab act as a frontâ€‘end while all code runs on your local machine, granting access to RoboDKâ€™s API. 

   Without one of these configurations, any attempt to collect RoboDK data directly in a standard Colab notebook will fail due to network restrictions between Colabâ€™s cloud servers and your local host.
